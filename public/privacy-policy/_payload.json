This fandom is known for its diverse and vibrant community, creative expression, and various activities centered around these anthropomorphic characters.\n\n### Key aspects of the furry fandom\n\n#### Inclusivity\n\n* **Sexuality**: The furry fandom has always been a strong safe-space for gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual & asexual members. It is welcoming to everyone regardless of how you identify.\n* **Gender**: More members than ever now identify as trans or gender non-conforming. The furry fandom creates an environment is which its members feel safe to be the people they truly are.\n* **Neurodivergent**: Be it autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or any of many other cognitive differences; the furry fandom knows how to embrace these traits in people and is stronger for it.\n\n#### Art and creativity\n\n* **Artwork**: One of the most prominent features of the furry fandom is the creation and sharing of artwork depicting anthropomorphic animals. This includes illustrations, digital art, comics, and animations.\n* **Literature and Music**: In addition to visual art, the fandom also includes writers and musicians who create works featuring anthropomorphic characters.\n* **Fursuits**: Some members create or commission elaborate costumes, called fursuits, that represent their anthropomorphic animal personas, or \"fursonas\".\n\n#### Fursonas\n\n* **Definition**: A fursona is a personalised anthropomorphic animal character created by a member of the furry fandom. It often reflects aspects of the person's personality, interests, or aspirations.\n* **Representation**: Fursonas can vary widely in species, appearance, and backstory, and they serve as avatars for interaction within the community.\n\n#### Conventions and gatherings:\n\n* **Conventions**: Large-scale events, such as Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, and Eurofurence, provide a space for fans to meet, share their work, participate in panels, and attend dances and other social events.\n* **Meetups**: Smaller, local gatherings and meetups also take place, providing more intimate settings for fans to connect.\n\n#### Online communities:\n\n* **Forums and Social Media**: The furry fandom has a significant online presence through forums, social media platforms, and dedicated websites like FurAffinity and DeviantArt.\n* **Roleplaying and Gaming**: Many fans engage in online roleplaying games, creating stories and scenarios for their fursonas.\n\n#### Diverse interests:\n\n* **Broad Backgrounds**: Members of the fandom come from virtually every walk of life, meaning almost any interest or hobby will find a home within the fandom.\n* **Charity Work**: Many furry conventions and events incorporate charity fundraisers, supporting various causes.\n\nThe furry fandom is a vibrant and creative community that celebrates anthropomorphic animal characters. Through art, conventions, online interactions, and personal expression, members connect over their shared interests and contribute to a rich and multifaceted subculture.\n\n::","2024-08-08T00:00+01:00",{"metadata":102,"sys":105,"fields":114},{"tags":103,"concepts":104},[],[],{"space":106,"id":108,"type":21,"createdAt":109,"updatedAt":109,"environment":110,"publishedVersion":29,"revision":6,"contentType":112,"locale":34},{"sys":107},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"3chVNlFEzUwRu6LLRE59s9","2025-02-13T17:29:16.774Z",{"sys":111},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},{"sys":113},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":52},{"title":115,"link":116},"Events",{"metadata":117,"sys":120,"fields":132},{"tags":118,"concepts":119},[],[],{"space":121,"id":123,"type":21,"createdAt":124,"updatedAt":125,"environment":126,"publishedVersion":128,"revision":129,"contentType":130,"locale":34},{"sys":122},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"6BTZml8MTqQkpoPQbDOadi","2024-08-10T12:20:09.119Z","2025-02-24T00:26:09.341Z",{"sys":127},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},340,16,{"sys":131},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":70},{"title":115,"slug":133,"body":134,"publishDate":135},"/events","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n## 31st October 2025: West Cumbria\n\nThis is a private, invite-only event being held in West Cumbria.

It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to support your application.\n\n## What next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by its members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee-assigned role stands down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to, even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited-by-guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with UK regulation and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on and only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach of legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[253],"general",{"metadata":255,"sys":258,"fields":268},{"tags":256,"concepts":257},[],[],{"space":259,"id":261,"type":21,"createdAt":262,"updatedAt":262,"environment":263,"publishedVersion":265,"revision":6,"contentType":266,"locale":34},{"sys":260},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"5rbKJTXOGsSBlajvb0y8xu","2025-05-19T15:33:39.108Z",{"sys":264},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},5,{"sys":267},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":52},{"title":269,"link":270},"Contact Information",{"metadata":271,"sys":274,"fields":286},{"tags":272,"concepts":273},[],[],{"space":275,"id":277,"type":21,"createdAt":278,"updatedAt":279,"environment":280,"publishedVersion":282,"revision":283,"contentType":284,"locale":34},{"sys":276},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"2YH4YXNFUP8j2x8LmkDLpq","2025-05-15T20:15:56.476Z","2025-05-21T19:14:57.481Z",{"sys":281},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},147,21,{"sys":285},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":70},{"title":287,"slug":288,"body":289,"publishDate":290},"Contact Us","/contact-us","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# Contact Information\n\nFurrific is operated by a team is made up of passionate members who dedicate their free time and energy throughout the year.\n\nGot a question, idea, encountered a problem, or just want to get in touch?

Any such information provided will only be used by the first-aid team on duty to ensure that any emergency relating to your medical condition is handled appropriately.\n* Some events or activities may have additional Terms and Conditions, you must abide by these if participating in such events or activities.\n* All final decisions with regard to club policies, procedures, and their implementation lie with the Furrific committee.\n\n## Your Membership\n\n* All events and membership options are subject to availability.\n* If you are opting for a residential option at an event, it is your responsibility to arrange another member to share the room with where applicable.\n* Once we have reviewed your registration and sent a confirmation to you via your chosen email address, you will be requested to pay the full amount of the registration fee. Should you fail to pay when requested, your registration may be cancelled and any place at the event lost. If you are struggling to pay your registration on time, please contact our team at registration@furrific.uk to review your options.\n* Equally, if your room share partner does not pay their registration fee on time, your room booking may be at risk. Please contact our registration team at registration@furrific.uk immediately if this is the case.\n* If you are a participant in a room share for which the other person is the leader, their room choice will override any that you have made and neither Furrific Ltd, the event venues, or any other entity will be responsible if this does not meet with your expectations or requirements. Please communicate clearly with your chosen room partner and agree on your requirements in advance.\n* You agree to the terms and conditions of whichever payment provider you use in order to complete payment of membership & event registration fees.\n* Once your registration for the club & any events is confirmed and paid we may be unable to refund this if you subsequently wish to cancel your membership or attendance.\n* You may be given the opportunity to upload an image to represent yourself on your membership badge. By using this functionality you bestow upon us the right to reproduce the image for the sole purpose of adding it to your membership badge and that you have the right to do so. The club may, at its discretion, decline an image should it be considered offensive or could bring the club into disrepute.\n\n## Cancellations\n\n* Furrific Ltd is not responsible for circumstances beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, or terrorism, extreme weather conditions, pandemic, or government action. Furrific Ltd reserves the right to cancel events with no warning in these circumstances.\n* In the event that an event is cancelled, Furrific Ltd will offer members refunds to the amount possible given expenses already incurred directly and with respect to commitments. By registering you accept both this and the possibility that, should the cancellation occur at a late enough point, such refunds may not be 100% and could in fact be zero.\n\n## Events\n\n* Event venues are private property and they have the right to refuse entry for any reason.\n* Service animals are permitted, for pets permission must be sought from the club committee and are only permitted where venues allow.\n* You must respect the wishes and follow any reasonable instructions of both venue staff, the club's event team, and any security personnel.\n* You agree to read the safety plans provided by venues in case of fire or other emergencies and to follow the rules implemented by the venue for these scenarios if they occur.\n* If you are not the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the event venue, you are not permitted to remain in the event spaces, communal areas, or venue rooms overnight and must leave the venue each day as soon as the last event or dance concludes. Attempting to stay in the venue overnight in contravention of this rule is strictly forbidden. The venue may seek to recover costs in these cases and the club will not be liable for covering these costs.\n* If you are the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the venue, you must not permit any non-residential member to stay in your hotel room overnight.\n* Any instance of the above that is discovered may lead to the removal of both the non-residential person from the event and any other members discovered to be facilitating this action. No refund will be given for ticket or accommodation in these cases, nor any other form of remuneration. At the discretion of committee, such instances may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the club or future events.\n* If you participate in any club auctions and submit a bid for an item on sale, you are entering a contract of commitment to pay the bid amount on completion of the auction in the event that you are the winning bidder.\n* Any care delivered by our first-aid team is given on a “best efforts” basis. The club and its teams volunteers are not responsible for any damage to property sustained while such care is delivered.\n* While reasonable effort is taken to ensure to avoid such incidents, by attending the event you may be exposed to allergens of various forms. Furrific UK Ltd, it's event venues, nor any other associated entity are not responsible for any injury or damage resulting from such exposure.\n\n## Your Property\n\n* Furrific Ltd and it's event hosts are not responsible for any of your property that is lost, stolen or damaged; this remains your responsibility at all times and includes any vehicle left in the venue car park, which is parked at your own risk. Please take all reasonable precautions to secure your vehicle and property.\n* If you choose to use the fursuit facilities at events, neither Furrific Ltd, the event venue, or any other entity can be held responsible for any damage to or loss of property sustained.\n* If you choose to participate in any activity at the event while wearing a costume of any kind, Furrific and the venue, nor any other entity, can be held responsible for any damage that it sustains.\n\n## Website & Provided Information\n\n* Data that you enter into our membership / event registration system will be protected as described in our Privacy Policy and in accordance with the Data Protection Act.

Furrific is primarily a not for profit members club which runs occasional events for its members. Other variations of the name may be used in trading.\n\nThis policy explains when and why we collect personal information about our members and others who may visit our website, how we use that information, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others, and how we keep it secure.\n\nThis policy is updated from time to time so please check this page occasionally to ensure that you are aware and happy with any changes. By using our website or becoming a member of Furrific you agree to be bound by this policy.\n\nAny questions regarding this policy and our privacy practices should be sent by email to [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk). You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regarding data protection issues, which can be reached via their website at [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/). However, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO and would ask that you please contact us in the first instance.\n\n## How and what information do we collect from you?\nWe do not collect specific information about you when you visit our website. Your browser may save preferences depending on your settings or pre-fill information; please check your browser settings for more information. If you choose to become a member of Furrific, register for one of our events, contact us about our operations, products, or services, or register to receive one of our newsletters or contact forms, we will retain personally identifiable information limited to that required for delivery of those services or requests.\n\nThe personal information we collect may include your name, registered address, email address, IP address, and information regarding what pages are accessed and when. If you make a payment online, your card information will not be held by us and instead it is collected by our third party payment processors who specialise in the secure processing of credit/debit card transactions. This is a technical requirement of their services.\n\nWe may collect, use, and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this policy.\n\nWe do not collect the following Special Categories of Personal Data about you; details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership or biometric data. Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences. We will collect medical information on a voluntary basis to allow the provision of first aid to be administered promptly and effectively. This information may be passed on to a doctor, medical professional or other emergency services as required for the protection and preservation of life.\n\n## How will we use your information?\n\nWe may use your information to:\n\n- Process or administer your membership or application thereof\n- Carry out any contractual obligations\n- Detect and reduce fraud and credit risk\n- Process any application to help out with our events or club operations\n- Notify of changes to our event operations, service delivery options, changes to membership or any other changes affecting you\n- Make you aware of any information regarding Furrific for which you would reasonably expect notice\n- Seek your views or comments on the events and services we provide\n- Send communications which you have requested\n- Identify and return lost property\n- Produce statistical summaries for open publication\n- To improve our services\n\nWe review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis and are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity concerned, as long as legally required, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.\n\n## Who has access to your information?\nYour personal information will not be sold to third parties nor will it be shared for marketing purposes. We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or apply our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our staff and customers. When you are using our secure online registration pages your payment may be processed by a third party payment processor who specialises in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions.\n\nWe may pass your information to our third party service providers, agents, subcontractors, and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf. However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to technically deliver the service and we will ensure that they will be required to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.\n\nWe will not release your information to third parties unless, as stated above, you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.\nIf you have any questions regarding secure transactions, please contact us via email at [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk).\n\n## Your choices and updating information\nIt is your choice whether or not you wish to receive information from us; generally all contact from us will be related to the direct delivery of membership services, including any events that Furrific may operate.

Should the system be closed please contact the club secretary and we will seek to update this in your place.\n\nShould you require a copy of the information held about you we may charge a reasonable administrative fee if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repeated following previous requests.\n\n## Security precautions used\n\nWe use a wide range of appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard access to, and use of, your personal information and to ensure it retains its integrity and availability. These include structured access controls to systems, network protection, intrusion detection, physical access controls, and staff training. We also consider anonymising or pseudonymising personal data where practical. Sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) will not be held by us and payment service providers will be expected to use encryption and protection to the highest standards.\n\nOnce we receive your information we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems and only retain data as long as required for the purposes of processing or legal requirements. Password access will be used internally which should be kept secret and not disclosed to others, if you have a password to allow access to certain areas of our website we would advise you keep this safe and secure.\n\n## Website cookies\nMost websites use cookies which are small text files that are placed on your device for various purposes including improving site functionality and facilitating various services.
