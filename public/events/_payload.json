It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to back your application.\n\n## What Next?\n\nExisting voting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your Furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if you secure over an approval rating over 90% you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership Fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by it's members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee assigned role stands-down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they\nwish to even if they're not interested in being on the committee.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited by guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with the UK government and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on, they only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach in legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[108],"general",{"Entry":110},[60],[112,113,114],{"title":36,"slug":37},{"title":57,"slug":58},{"title":102,"slug":103},{"title":36,"body":38,"heroImage":-1},{"data":117,"body":119,"excerpt":-1,"toc":152},{"title":118,"description":118},"",{"type":120,"children":121},"root",[122,131,137,142,147],{"type":123,"tag":124,"props":125,"children":127},"element","h2",{"id":126},"west-cumbria-2025",[128],{"type":129,"value":130},"text","West Cumbria 2025",{"type":123,"tag":132,"props":133,"children":134},"p",{},[135],{"type":129,"value":136},"Our first event is being held in West Cumbria.",{"type":123,"tag":132,"props":138,"children":139},{},[140],{"type":129,"value":141},"It will operate Fri - Mon with entertainments provided from Fri afternoon to Sunday midnight.",{"type":123,"tag":132,"props":143,"children":144},{},[145],{"type":129,"value":146},"Estimated cost is currently £250 - £310 per person for a 3 night stay with breakfast & lunch buffet including event ticket.",{"type":123,"tag":132,"props":148,"children":149},{},[150],{"type":129,"value":151},"This is a private invite only event.",{"title":118,"searchDepth":29,"depth":29,"links":153},[154],{"id":126,"depth":29,"text":130},1730757482608]
