Typically, this will be just your Furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if you secure over an approval\nrating over 90% you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership Fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is operated democratically and at the AGM members elect the\noperating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a\ncommittee position or committee assigned role stands-down and must be re-elected\nif they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they\nwish to even if they're not interested in being on the committee.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited by guarantee\ncompany. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with the UK government\nand overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly\ndelegated to the committee, they only veto decisions in matters where there would\nbe a conflict of interest or a breach in legislation.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\n::\n",{"metadata":333,"sys":335,"fields":346},{"tags":334},[],{"space":336,"id":338,"type":317,"createdAt":339,"updatedAt":340,"environment":341,"revision":298,"contentType":343,"locale":24},{"sys":337},{"type":13,"linkType":14,"id":15},"15jwOBqpxqSAOy2eOO4S0m","2024-06-04T23:50:39.089Z","2024-06-05T13:58:04.865Z",{"sys":342},{"id":21,"type":13,"linkType":22},{"sys":344},{"type":13,"linkType":325,"id":345},"person",{"name":347,"title":348,"company":349,"shortBio":350,"email":351},"Frío","Director","Furrific Ltd","Research and recommendations for modern stack websites.","aaron.p@furrific.uk","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[354],"general",{"metadata":356,"sys":358,"fields":368},{"tags":357},[],{"space":359,"id":361,"type":317,"createdAt":362,"updatedAt":363,"environment":364,"revision":322,"contentType":366,"locale":24},{"sys":360},{"type":13,"linkType":14,"id":15},"2PtC9h1YqIA6kaUaIsWEQ0","2024-06-04T23:50:40.511Z","2024-06-05T14:06:30.777Z",{"sys":365},{"id":21,"type":13,"linkType":22},{"sys":367},{"type":13,"linkType":325,"id":326},{"title":369,"slug":370,"description":369,"body":371,"author":332,"publishDate":372,"tags":373},"About Furrific","about","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# What is Furrific\n\nFurrific is a UK based members only club operated for and by its membership.\n\n# What we do\n\nWe arrange social events for our members, bringing together furries from different sub-communities.\nWe also help promote members business interests.
