It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to support your application.\n\n## What next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by its members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee-assigned role stands down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to, even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited-by-guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with UK regulation and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on and only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach of legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[269],"general",{"metadata":271,"sys":274,"fields":284},{"tags":272,"concepts":273},[],[],{"space":275,"id":277,"type":53,"createdAt":278,"updatedAt":279,"environment":280,"publishedVersion":58,"revision":200,"contentType":282,"locale":26},{"sys":276},{"type":14,"linkType":15,"id":16},"2uQKKZh9W5YCmJqVhwtb89","2025-02-13T17:41:06.639Z","2025-02-13T18:53:22.150Z",{"sys":281},{"id":22,"type":14,"linkType":23},{"sys":283},{"type":14,"linkType":62,"id":81},{"title":285,"link":286},"Terms and Conditions",{"metadata":287,"sys":290,"fields":301},{"tags":288,"concepts":289},[],[],{"space":291,"id":293,"type":53,"createdAt":294,"updatedAt":295,"environment":296,"publishedVersion":298,"revision":58,"contentType":299,"locale":26},{"sys":292},{"type":14,"linkType":15,"id":16},"2utBAXLZGRYfQERXhb0zWd","2025-01-22T02:27:37.666Z","2025-02-16T22:25:32.311Z",{"sys":297},{"id":22,"type":14,"linkType":23},263,{"sys":300},{"type":14,"linkType":62,"id":98},{"title":285,"slug":302,"body":303,"publishDate":150},"/legal/terms-and-conditions","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# Terms and Conditions\n\n## Definitions\n\n\"You\", \"member\", \"your\", and \"yourself\" relate to the person agreeing to these terms and conditions. “We”, \"our\", “Furrific”, \"club\" and “event” relate to the Furrific members club which is brought to you by the registered company, Furrific UK Ltd, company number 15666730, with registered address of Unit A, 82 James Carter Road, Mildenhall, United Kingdom, IP28 7DE.\n\n## What is this Document?\n\nThis document sets out the terms of conditions for membership and attendance of Furrific events.

Furrific is primarily a not for profit members club which runs occasional events for its members. Other variations of the name may be used in trading.\n\nThis policy explains when and why we collect personal information about our members and others who may visit our website, how we use that information, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others, and how we keep it secure.\n\nThis policy is updated from time to time so please check this page occasionally to ensure that you are aware and happy with any changes. By using our website or becoming a member of Furrific you agree to be bound by this policy.\n\nAny questions regarding this policy and our privacy practices should be sent by email to [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk). You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regarding data protection issues, which can be reached via their website at [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/). However, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO and would ask that you please contact us in the first instance.\n\n## How and what information do we collect from you?\nWe do not collect specific information about you when you visit our website. Your browser may save preferences depending on your settings or pre-fill information; please check your browser settings for more information. If you choose to become a member of Furrific, register for one of our events, contact us about our operations, products, or services, or register to receive one of our newsletters or contact forms, we will retain personally identifiable information limited to that required for delivery of those services or requests.\n\nThe personal information we collect may include your name, registered address, email address, IP address, and information regarding what pages are accessed and when. If you make a payment online, your card information will not be held by us and instead it is collected by our third party payment processors who specialise in the secure processing of credit/debit card transactions. This is a technical requirement of their services.\n\nWe may collect, use, and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this policy.\n\nWe do not collect the following Special Categories of Personal Data about you; details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership or biometric data. Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences. We will collect medical information on a voluntary basis to allow the provision of first aid to be administered promptly and effectively.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity concerned, as long as legally required, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.\n\n## Who has access to your information?\nYour personal information will not be sold to third parties nor will it be shared for marketing purposes. We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or apply our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our staff and customers. When you are using our secure online registration pages your payment may be processed by a third party payment processor who specialises in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions.\n\nWe may pass your information to our third party service providers, agents, subcontractors, and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf. However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to technically deliver the service and we will ensure that they will be required to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.\n\nWe will not release your information to third parties unless, as stated above, you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.\nIf you have any questions regarding secure transactions, please contact us via email at [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk).\n\n## Your choices and updating information\nIt is your choice whether or not you wish to receive information from us; generally all contact from us will be related to the direct delivery of membership services, including any events that Furrific may operate.

If you wish to change your preferences after selecting them at any time, please email us at [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk).\n\nGenerally, to update the details that we hold for you, you will need to log in to our [registration system](https://reg.furrific.uk/) and amend your details accordingly. Should the system be closed please contact the club secretary and we will seek to update this in your place.\n\nShould you require a copy of the information held about you we may charge a reasonable administrative fee if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repeated following previous requests.\n\n## Security precautions used\n\nWe use a wide range of appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard access to, and use of, your personal information and to ensure it retains its integrity and availability. These include structured access controls to systems, network protection, intrusion detection, physical access controls, and staff training. We also consider anonymising or pseudonymising personal data where practical. Sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) will not be held by us and payment service providers will be expected to use encryption and protection to the highest standards.\n\nOnce we receive your information we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems and only retain data as long as required for the purposes of processing or legal requirements. Password access will be used internally which should be kept secret and not disclosed to others, if you have a password to allow access to certain areas of our website we would advise you keep this safe and secure.\n\n## Website cookies\nMost websites use cookies which are small text files that are placed on your device for various purposes including improving site functionality and facilitating various services.
