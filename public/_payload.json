It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to back your application.\n\n## What Next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your Furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership Fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by it's members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee assigned role stands-down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited by guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with the UK government and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on, they only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach in legislation.\n\n::\n",{"metadata":62,"sys":65,"fields":78},{"tags":63,"concepts":64},[],[],{"space":66,"id":68,"type":21,"createdAt":69,"updatedAt":70,"environment":71,"publishedVersion":73,"revision":74,"contentType":75,"locale":34},{"sys":67},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"15jwOBqpxqSAOy2eOO4S0m","2024-06-04T23:50:39.089Z","2024-06-05T13:58:04.865Z",{"sys":72},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},6,2,{"sys":76},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":77},"person",{"name":79,"title":80,"company":81,"shortBio":82,"email":83},"Frío","Director","Furrific Ltd","Research and recommendations for modern stack websites.","aaron.p@furrific.uk","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[86],"general",{"metadata":88,"sys":91,"fields":103},{"tags":89,"concepts":90},[],[],{"space":92,"id":94,"type":21,"createdAt":95,"updatedAt":96,"environment":97,"publishedVersion":99,"revision":100,"contentType":101,"locale":34},{"sys":93},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"2PtC9h1YqIA6kaUaIsWEQ0","2024-06-04T23:50:40.511Z","2024-08-10T12:07:52.297Z",{"sys":98},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},58,5,{"sys":102},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":33},{"title":104,"slug":105,"description":104,"body":106,"author":61,"publishDate":107,"tags":108},"About Furrific","about","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# What is Furrific\n\nFurrific is a UK based members only club operated for and by its membership.

This fandom is known for its diverse and vibrant community, creative expression, and various activities centered around these anthropomorphic characters.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Furry Fandom\n\n#### Inclusivity\n\n* **Sexuality**: The furry fandom has always been a strong safe-space for gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual & asexual members. It is welcoming to everyone regardless of how you identify.\n* **Gender**: More members than ever now identify as trans or gender non-conforming. The furry fandom creates an environment is which it's members feel safe to be the people they truly are.\n* **Neurodivergent**: Be it autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia any many other cognitive differences; the furry fandom knows how to embrace these traits in people and is stronger for it.\n\n#### Art and Creativity\n\n* **Artwork**: One of the most prominent features of the furry fandom is the creation and sharing of artwork depicting anthropomorphic animals. This includes illustrations, digital art, comics, and animations.\n* **Fursuits**: Some members create or commission elaborate costumes, called fursuits, that represent their anthropomorphic animal personas, or \"fursonas.\"\n\n#### Fursonas\n\n* **Definition**: A fursona is a personalized anthropomorphic animal character created by a member of the furry fandom. It often reflects aspects of the person's personality, interests, or aspirations.\n* **Representation**: Fursonas can vary widely in species, appearance, and backstory, and they serve as avatars for interaction within the community.\n\n#### Conventions and Gatherings:\n\n* **Conventions**: Large-scale events, such as Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, and Eurofurence, provide a space for fans to meet, share their work, participate in panels, and attend dances and other social events.\n* **Meetups**: Smaller, local gatherings and meetups also take place, providing more intimate settings for fans to connect.\n\n#### Online Communities:\n\n* **Forums and Social Media**: The furry fandom has a significant online presence through forums, social media platforms, and dedicated websites like Fur Affinity and DeviantArt.\n* **Role-Playing and Gaming**: Many fans engage in online role-playing games, creating stories and scenarios for their fursonas.\n\n#### Diverse Interests:\n\n* **Literature and Music**: In addition to visual art, the fandom also includes writers and musicians who create works featuring anthropomorphic characters.\n* **Charity Work**: Many furry conventions and events incorporate charity fundraisers, supporting various causes.\n\nThe furry fandom is a vibrant and creative community that celebrates anthropomorphic animal characters. Through art, conventions, online interactions, and personal expression, members connect over their shared interests and contribute to a rich and multifaceted subculture.\n\n::",["Reactive",121],{"metadata":122,"sys":125,"fields":134},{"tags":123,"concepts":124},[],[],{"space":126,"id":128,"type":129,"createdAt":130,"updatedAt":130,"environment":131,"publishedVersion":73,"revision":133,"locale":34},{"sys":127},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"5Dq9eFU6EpZohsz8kcRyem","Asset","2024-08-08T22:19:15.080Z",{"sys":132},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},1,{"title":135,"description":136,"file":137},"Main Logo - Black","SVG Version of main logo",{"url":138,"details":139,"fileName":144,"contentType":145},"//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/5Dq9eFU6EpZohsz8kcRyem/5ab42a84ef528df9ba5f92c487c51642/logo.svg",{"size":140,"image":141},22647,{"width":142,"height":143},396,203,"logo.svg","image/svg+xml",{"data":147,"body":149,"excerpt":-1,"toc":406},{"title":148,"description":148},"",{"type":150,"children":151},"root",[152],{"type":153,"tag":154,"props":155,"children":158},"element","div",{"className":156},[157],"content-index",[159,172,185,194,201,206,213,220,256,262,285,291,314,320,343,349,372,378,401],{"type":153,"tag":160,"props":161,"children":162},"h1",{"id":148},[163],{"type":153,"tag":164,"props":165,"children":171},"img",{"alt":166,"className":167,"height":143,"src":170,"width":142},"Furrific",[168,169],"mx-auto","block","images/logo.svg",[],{"type":153,"tag":154,"props":173,"children":177},{"className":174},[175,176],"font-medium","text-center",[178],{"type":153,"tag":179,"props":180,"children":181},"p",{},[182],{"type":183,"value":184},"text","A Club for the Furry Fandom",{"type":153,"tag":154,"props":186,"children":188},{"className":187},[176],[189],{"type":153,"tag":179,"props":190,"children":191},{},[192],{"type":183,"value":193},"Furrific is a UK based non-profit members only club operated for and by its membership.",{"type":153,"tag":195,"props":196,"children":198},"h2",{"id":197},"furry-fandom",[199],{"type":183,"value":200},"Furry fandom?",{"type":153,"tag":179,"props":202,"children":203},{},[204],{"type":183,"value":205},"The furry fandom is a subculture with many members identifying as LGBTQ+ interested in anthropomorphic animal characters—animals with human traits, such as walking on two legs, wearing clothes, or speaking.
