This fandom is known for its diverse and vibrant community, creative expression, and various activities centered around these anthropomorphic characters.\n\n### Key aspects of the furry fandom\n\n#### Inclusivity\n\n* **Sexuality**: The furry fandom has always been a strong safe-space for gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual & asexual members. It is welcoming to everyone regardless of how you identify.\n* **Gender**: More members than ever now identify as trans or gender non-conforming. The furry fandom creates an environment is which its members feel safe to be the people they truly are.\n* **Neurodivergent**: Be it autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or any of many other cognitive differences; the furry fandom knows how to embrace these traits in people and is stronger for it.\n\n#### Art and creativity\n\n* **Artwork**: One of the most prominent features of the furry fandom is the creation and sharing of artwork depicting anthropomorphic animals. This includes illustrations, digital art, comics, and animations.\n* **Literature and Music**: In addition to visual art, the fandom also includes writers and musicians who create works featuring anthropomorphic characters.\n* **Fursuits**: Some members create or commission elaborate costumes, called fursuits, that represent their anthropomorphic animal personas, or \"fursonas\".\n\n#### Fursonas\n\n* **Definition**: A fursona is a personalised anthropomorphic animal character created by a member of the furry fandom. It often reflects aspects of the person's personality, interests, or aspirations.\n* **Representation**: Fursonas can vary widely in species, appearance, and backstory, and they serve as avatars for interaction within the community.\n\n#### Conventions and gatherings:\n\n* **Conventions**: Large-scale events, such as Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, and Eurofurence, provide a space for fans to meet, share their work, participate in panels, and attend dances and other social events.\n* **Meetups**: Smaller, local gatherings and meetups also take place, providing more intimate settings for fans to connect.\n\n#### Online communities:\n\n* **Forums and Social Media**: The furry fandom has a significant online presence through forums, social media platforms, and dedicated websites like FurAffinity and DeviantArt.\n* **Roleplaying and Gaming**: Many fans engage in online roleplaying games, creating stories and scenarios for their fursonas.\n\n#### Diverse interests:\n\n* **Broad Backgrounds**: Members of the fandom come from virtually every walk of life, meaning almost any interest or hobby will find a home within the fandom.\n* **Charity Work**: Many furry conventions and events incorporate charity fundraisers, supporting various causes.\n\nThe furry fandom is a vibrant and creative community that celebrates anthropomorphic animal characters. Through art, conventions, online interactions, and personal expression, members connect over their shared interests and contribute to a rich and multifaceted subculture.\n\n::","2024-08-08T00:00+01:00",{"metadata":102,"sys":105,"fields":114},{"tags":103,"concepts":104},[],[],{"space":106,"id":108,"type":21,"createdAt":109,"updatedAt":109,"environment":110,"publishedVersion":29,"revision":6,"contentType":112,"locale":34},{"sys":107},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"3chVNlFEzUwRu6LLRE59s9","2025-02-13T17:29:16.774Z",{"sys":111},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},{"sys":113},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":52},{"title":115,"link":116},"Events",{"metadata":117,"sys":120,"fields":132},{"tags":118,"concepts":119},[],[],{"space":121,"id":123,"type":21,"createdAt":124,"updatedAt":125,"environment":126,"publishedVersion":128,"revision":129,"contentType":130,"locale":34},{"sys":122},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"6BTZml8MTqQkpoPQbDOadi","2024-08-10T12:20:09.119Z","2025-02-24T00:26:09.341Z",{"sys":127},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},340,16,{"sys":131},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":70},{"title":115,"slug":133,"body":134,"publishDate":135},"/events","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n## 31st October 2025: West Cumbria\n\nThis is a private, invite-only event being held in West Cumbria.

It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to support your application.\n\n## What next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by its members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee-assigned role stands down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to, even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited-by-guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with UK regulation and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on and only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach of legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[253],"general",{"metadata":255,"sys":258,"fields":268},{"tags":256,"concepts":257},[],[],{"space":259,"id":261,"type":21,"createdAt":262,"updatedAt":262,"environment":263,"publishedVersion":265,"revision":6,"contentType":266,"locale":34},{"sys":260},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"5rbKJTXOGsSBlajvb0y8xu","2025-05-19T15:33:39.108Z",{"sys":264},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},5,{"sys":267},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":52},{"title":269,"link":270},"Contact Information",{"metadata":271,"sys":274,"fields":286},{"tags":272,"concepts":273},[],[],{"space":275,"id":277,"type":21,"createdAt":278,"updatedAt":279,"environment":280,"publishedVersion":282,"revision":283,"contentType":284,"locale":34},{"sys":276},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"2YH4YXNFUP8j2x8LmkDLpq","2025-05-15T20:15:56.476Z","2025-05-21T19:14:57.481Z",{"sys":281},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},147,21,{"sys":285},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":70},{"title":287,"slug":288,"body":289,"publishDate":290},"Contact Us","/contact-us","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# Contact Information\n\nFurrific is operated by a team is made up of passionate members who dedicate their free time and energy throughout the year.\n\nGot a question, idea, encountered a problem, or just want to get in touch?

Any such information provided will only be used by the first-aid team on duty to ensure that any emergency relating to your medical condition is handled appropriately.\n* Some events or activities may have additional Terms and Conditions, you must abide by these if participating in such events or activities.\n* All final decisions with regard to club policies, procedures, and their implementation lie with the Furrific committee.\n\n## Your Membership\n\n* All events and membership options are subject to availability.\n* If you are opting for a residential option at an event, it is your responsibility to arrange another member to share the room with where applicable.\n* Once we have reviewed your registration and sent a confirmation to you via your chosen email address, you will be requested to pay the full amount of the registration fee. Should you fail to pay when requested, your registration may be cancelled and any place at the event lost. If you are struggling to pay your registration on time, please contact our team at registration@furrific.uk to review your options.\n* Equally, if your room share partner does not pay their registration fee on time, your room booking may be at risk. Please contact our registration team at registration@furrific.uk immediately if this is the case.\n* If you are a participant in a room share for which the other person is the leader, their room choice will override any that you have made and neither Furrific Ltd, the event venues, or any other entity will be responsible if this does not meet with your expectations or requirements.

Furrific Ltd reserves the right to cancel events with no warning in these circumstances.\n* In the event that an event is cancelled, Furrific Ltd will offer members refunds to the amount possible given expenses already incurred directly and with respect to commitments. By registering you accept both this and the possibility that, should the cancellation occur at a late enough point, such refunds may not be 100% and could in fact be zero.\n\n## Events\n\n* Event venues are private property and they have the right to refuse entry for any reason.\n* Service animals are permitted, for pets permission must be sought from the club committee and are only permitted where venues allow.\n* You must respect the wishes and follow any reasonable instructions of both venue staff, the club's event team, and any security personnel.\n* You agree to read the safety plans provided by venues in case of fire or other emergencies and to follow the rules implemented by the venue for these scenarios if they occur.\n* If you are not the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the event venue, you are not permitted to remain in the event spaces, communal areas, or venue rooms overnight and must leave the venue each day as soon as the last event or dance concludes. Attempting to stay in the venue overnight in contravention of this rule is strictly forbidden. The venue may seek to recover costs in these cases and the club will not be liable for covering these costs.\n* If you are the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the venue, you must not permit any non-residential member to stay in your hotel room overnight.\n* Any instance of the above that is discovered may lead to the removal of both the non-residential person from the event and any other members discovered to be facilitating this action.

Furrific isn't just another convention but a members-only club. Membership is deliberately limited to retain an old-school, small convention vibe in which you can walk into a room and feel surrounded by friends from afar.\n\nThe club is kicking off with its first event at the Seacote Hotel in St. Bees. We'll have a full line up of events just as you'd expect with a small convention. It won't be too heavy and there'll be plenty of time to simply relax and socialise.\n\nEvery member is invited to be involved as much or little as they would like, all contributions are welcome.\n\nAs a members club all new members must be invited by two existing members that act as their referees before being approved by committee. If we no longer have capacity remaining at our events then new membership approvals will be held until the club's members approve expansion.\n\nYou might've noticed a small detail there, about the club members approving something. The club is fully democratic; every year a committee is elected to steer the club but large, sweeping changes are voted on by all members at an AGM (Annual General Meeting). That means, as a member, you directly decide who you want to lead the club and vote on the big decisions.\n\nBut it's not just about hotels & meetings, as a club we aim to eventually bring additional benefits such as web & email hosting, skills sharing & workshops and more…\n\nMembership is just £5 per year whether you attend an event or not. For the first event the membership fee is included in the event ticket. If you’ve been invited but can’t attend our first event but would still like to join the club or future events you can still register just for membership.\n\n## Venue\n\nSeacote Hotel, St. Bees, West Cumbria 31st October 2025\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"hotel-image\">\n\n![Seacote Hotel Outside](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3JB8fXVjCblGcfeEy3NJp1/a6ccb0afa1ba82795c19ffad27b37853/Seacote_Hotel.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe have secured use of the Seacote Hotel in St. Bees. This is a traditional, large seaside hotel without the corporate vibe of modern conference facilities. They’ve got a large event space with bar & catering for us to have a great time in, as well as separate bar & restaurant areas you may use if you just need to get away from things for a bit.\n\nThe hotel is situated next to St. Bees beach which is fantastic for taking in the sea air or just going for a stroll. There’s ample car parking for everyone, and the nearest train station is just a 10-minute walk away.\n\n### Bedrooms\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"hotel-bedroom-images\">\n\n![Seacote Double Bedroom](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3bI7EoTL5p15W0TEFHZQPe/1a5fd1bc8e344af30e9664f17c549ef7/Double_Bedroom.jpg)\n![Seacote Twin Bedroom](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/vNOFzFsRbSjnlXwnsrRmT/54eb0da1b62c04ae11ae3d7b394d4b5a/Twin_Bedroom.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe’ve a variety of options for your stay which include single, double, twin, triple, and quad rooms.

But we hope you’ll agree that they all represent excellent value for money.\n\n### Food\n\nAll meals from Friday evening until Monday morning are included in your stay. We’ll be providing breakfast, a lunch buffet, and a dinner buffet with dessert options included. Dining options in the local area are limited so we’re sure you’ll appreciate not going hungry!\n\nVegan & gluten-free options will also be provided but do be sure to let us know if you have any specific requirements so we can ensure you are catered for.\n\nFor those with early arrival as part of your registration, lunch is also available on the Friday. However, those with late departure on the Monday will need to make their own arrangements after breakfast on the Monday.\n\nPlease note that food from outside the venue can be consumed on the premises when the hotel kitchen is closed; please check when on site for details of when this is.\n\n## Cost\n\nAll prices are per-person based on a 3-night stay. Prices are based on maximum occupancy of the room.

That can be arranged too. Please keep in mind that these nights are provided for convenience or to enable you to do some local sight seeing. All prices are based on maximum occupancy of rooms.

Once your membership is approved you can contact other members through our Telegram group to see if there’s anyone interested in being a room mate.\n\n## Entertainments\n\nThere will be lots going on in St. Bees this Halloween! Check out our daily timetables below to see what you could be getting up to.\n\n- [Friday Timetable](//assets.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/6WU8YW5279gc4xoa79fDlu/9c185f3a8d178ad1c170b300f2129868/Events_Friday.pdf)\n- [Saturday Timetable](//assets.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/ObXDwXZYnemTYeCFD2MlZ/23cbdd1ed9a9298c981356d266567e7c/Events_Saturday.pdf)\n- [Sunday Timetable](//assets.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3yFPE9svyD8NMjgJf8ssWf/6df39c8b4cfa3e616c445d0a4cf3c254/Events_Sunday.pdf)\n\n### Fursuit lounge\n\nThe lounge area will be a simple side room from the primary event space providing fans, water & light snacks.\n\n## Travel\n\nThere are a number of ways to get to St. Bees. Whether you're travelling in by road, rail, or air, our recommendations for how to reach us are below.\n\n### By Car\n\nFor satnavs, the postcode for the Seacote Hotel is CA27 0ES. However, we would strongly considering the following routes when planning and embarking on your journey.\n\n__From the South:__ Use M6 junction 40 (Penrith), then A66 West, then A595 South. We strongly advise against using M6 junction 36, as the road between there and St. Bees is very poor. Although longer, you will find exiting at junction 40 to be quicker and easier overall.\n\n__From the North:__ Use M6 junction 44 (Carlisle), then A595 South.\n\n__From the East:__ Use A1(M) junction 53 (Scotch Corner), then A66 West, then A595 South.\n\n__All Routes, Once on the A595 South:__ Travel as far as Whitehaven. On exiting Whitehaven look out for a right turn on to Mirehouse Road, which should be signposted as a route for St. Bees. At the end of this road there is a T-junction. Turn left here and follow the B5345 (St. Bees Road). After almost 2 miles, just after entering St. Bees, the road turns sharply left. Here, take the right turn, which is essentially driving straight on rather than taking the turn, and follow Abbey Road. After a further half-mile you will see the Seacote Hotel Car Park on your left with the hotel behind it.\n\n### Car Parking\n\nOnly certain parking spaces around the hotel are for use by hotel residents. Please make sure you park in these spaces and display the parking permit that will be provided to you when you check into the hotel. The diagram below shows which spaces are for hotel residents; please park in the area highlighted in green. Parking without displaying the permit or parking in any other area without a pay & display ticket may result in you receiving a fine, so be sure to check that you are parked in a valid space!\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"parking-image\">\n\n![Car Parking](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/2cFs4cFJihnBgTvMwEle3x/12aa3c0a9a6746668c1586d62cac531f/Furrific_Parking.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Vehicle Recharging & Refuelling\n\n__Electric Vehicles:__ There are a number of electric vehicle charging points in Whitehaven, about five miles away from our venue. Morrisons have a number available – the postcode for this site is CA28 7RQ.\n\n__Petrol & Diesel Vehicles:__ There are a number of petrol stations in Whitehaven. Both Morrisons and Tesco have one and the postcodes for these sites are CA28 7RW and CA28 7XY respectively.\n\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee the operation or availability of the above services!\n\n### By Train\n\nSt. Bees has its own train station with an easy 10-15 minute walk (0.6 miles) to the Seacote Hotel. The train station is on the Cumbrian Coast Line with connections to the West Coast Main Line at Carlisle and Lancaster.\n\nFrom the Train Station: From the main entrance to the train station, take a left turn on to Main Street, then turn left again after 50m onto Station Road. Follow this road for 500m and it will merge with Beach Road. Continue to follow Beach Road for another 300m and you should come to the Seacote Hotel Car Park on the left with the hotel behind it.\n\nIf you reach the larger Beachfront Car Park or your feet become wet because you have entered the sea, you have gone too far and need to retrace your steps.\n\n### By Air\n\nManchester Airport is generally the best option and offers several connections to the train routes above with a journey time of about four to five hours. It is approximately three hours drive from St. Bees.\n\nGlasgow Airport offers fewer connections to the train routes above and will require a bus ride to Glasgow Central station with an overall journey time of about four and a half hours.
