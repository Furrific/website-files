This fandom is known for its diverse and vibrant community, creative expression, and various activities centered around these anthropomorphic characters.\n\n### Key aspects of the furry fandom\n\n#### Inclusivity\n\n* **Sexuality**: The furry fandom has always been a strong safe-space for gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual & asexual members. It is welcoming to everyone regardless of how you identify.\n* **Gender**: More members than ever now identify as trans or gender non-conforming. The furry fandom creates an environment is which its members feel safe to be the people they truly are.\n* **Neurodivergent**: Be it autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or any of many other cognitive differences; the furry fandom knows how to embrace these traits in people and is stronger for it.\n\n#### Art and creativity\n\n* **Artwork**: One of the most prominent features of the furry fandom is the creation and sharing of artwork depicting anthropomorphic animals. This includes illustrations, digital art, comics, and animations.\n* **Literature and Music**: In addition to visual art, the fandom also includes writers and musicians who create works featuring anthropomorphic characters.\n* **Fursuits**: Some members create or commission elaborate costumes, called fursuits, that represent their anthropomorphic animal personas, or \"fursonas\".\n\n#### Fursonas\n\n* **Definition**: A fursona is a personalised anthropomorphic animal character created by a member of the furry fandom. It often reflects aspects of the person's personality, interests, or aspirations.\n* **Representation**: Fursonas can vary widely in species, appearance, and backstory, and they serve as avatars for interaction within the community.\n\n#### Conventions and gatherings:\n\n* **Conventions**: Large-scale events, such as Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, and Eurofurence, provide a space for fans to meet, share their work, participate in panels, and attend dances and other social events.\n* **Meetups**: Smaller, local gatherings and meetups also take place, providing more intimate settings for fans to connect.\n\n#### Online communities:\n\n* **Forums and Social Media**: The furry fandom has a significant online presence through forums, social media platforms, and dedicated websites like FurAffinity and DeviantArt.\n* **Roleplaying and Gaming**: Many fans engage in online roleplaying games, creating stories and scenarios for their fursonas.\n\n#### Diverse interests:\n\n* **Broad Backgrounds**: Members of the fandom come from virtually every walk of life, meaning almost any interest or hobby will find a home within the fandom.\n* **Charity Work**: Many furry conventions and events incorporate charity fundraisers, supporting various causes.\n\nThe furry fandom is a vibrant and creative community that celebrates anthropomorphic animal characters. Through art, conventions, online interactions, and personal expression, members connect over their shared interests and contribute to a rich and multifaceted subculture.\n\n::","2024-08-08T00:00+01:00",{"metadata":102,"sys":105,"fields":114},{"tags":103,"concepts":104},[],[],{"space":106,"id":108,"type":21,"createdAt":109,"updatedAt":109,"environment":110,"publishedVersion":29,"revision":6,"contentType":112,"locale":34},{"sys":107},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"3chVNlFEzUwRu6LLRE59s9","2025-02-13T17:29:16.774Z",{"sys":111},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},{"sys":113},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":52},{"title":115,"link":116},"Events",{"metadata":117,"sys":120,"fields":132},{"tags":118,"concepts":119},[],[],{"space":121,"id":123,"type":21,"createdAt":124,"updatedAt":125,"environment":126,"publishedVersion":128,"revision":129,"contentType":130,"locale":34},{"sys":122},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"6BTZml8MTqQkpoPQbDOadi","2024-08-10T12:20:09.119Z","2025-02-24T00:26:09.341Z",{"sys":127},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},340,16,{"sys":131},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":70},{"title":115,"slug":133,"body":134,"publishDate":135},"/events","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n## 31st October 2025: West Cumbria\n\nThis is a private, invite-only event being held in West Cumbria.

It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to support your application.\n\n## What next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by its members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee-assigned role stands down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to, even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited-by-guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with UK regulation and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on and only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach of legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[254],"general",{"metadata":256,"sys":259,"fields":269},{"tags":257,"concepts":258},[],[],{"space":260,"id":262,"type":21,"createdAt":263,"updatedAt":264,"environment":265,"publishedVersion":28,"revision":185,"contentType":267,"locale":34},{"sys":261},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"2uQKKZh9W5YCmJqVhwtb89","2025-02-13T17:41:06.639Z","2025-02-13T18:53:22.150Z",{"sys":266},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},{"sys":268},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":52},{"title":270,"link":271},"Terms and Conditions",{"metadata":272,"sys":275,"fields":286},{"tags":273,"concepts":274},[],[],{"space":276,"id":278,"type":21,"createdAt":279,"updatedAt":280,"environment":281,"publishedVersion":283,"revision":28,"contentType":284,"locale":34},{"sys":277},{"type":17,"linkType":18,"id":19},"2utBAXLZGRYfQERXhb0zWd","2025-01-22T02:27:37.666Z","2025-02-16T22:25:32.311Z",{"sys":282},{"id":26,"type":17,"linkType":27},263,{"sys":285},{"type":17,"linkType":32,"id":70},{"title":270,"slug":287,"body":288,"publishDate":135},"/legal/terms-and-conditions","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# Terms and Conditions\n\n## Definitions\n\n\"You\", \"member\", \"your\", and \"yourself\" relate to the person agreeing to these terms and conditions. “We”, \"our\", “Furrific”, \"club\" and “event” relate to the Furrific members club which is brought to you by the registered company, Furrific UK Ltd, company number 15666730, with registered address of Unit A, 82 James Carter Road, Mildenhall, United Kingdom, IP28 7DE.\n\n## What is this Document?\n\nThis document sets out the terms of conditions for membership and attendance of Furrific events.

Aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.

We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or apply our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our staff and customers. When you are using our secure online registration pages your payment may be processed by a third party payment processor who specialises in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions.\n\nWe may pass your information to our third party service providers, agents, subcontractors, and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf. However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to technically deliver the service and we will ensure that they will be required to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.\n\nWe will not release your information to third parties unless, as stated above, you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.\nIf you have any questions regarding secure transactions, please contact us via email at [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk).\n\n## Your choices and updating information\nIt is your choice whether or not you wish to receive information from us; generally all contact from us will be related to the direct delivery of membership services, including any events that Furrific may operate.

Should the system be closed please contact the club secretary and we will seek to update this in your place.\n\nShould you require a copy of the information held about you we may charge a reasonable administrative fee if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repeated following previous requests.\n\n## Security precautions used\n\nWe use a wide range of appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard access to, and use of, your personal information and to ensure it retains its integrity and availability. These include structured access controls to systems, network protection, intrusion detection, physical access controls, and staff training. We also consider anonymising or pseudonymising personal data where practical.

Furrific isn't just another convention but a members-only club. Membership is deliberately limited to retain an old-school, small convention vibe in which you can walk into a room and feel surrounded by friends from afar.\n\nThe club is kicking off with its first event at the Seacote Hotel in St. Bees. We'll have a full line up of events just as you'd expect with a small convention. It won't be too heavy and there'll be plenty of time to simply relax and socialise.\n\nEvery member is invited to be involved as much or little as they would like, all contributions are welcome.\n\nAs a members club all new members must be invited by two existing members that act as their referees before being approved by committee. If we no longer have capacity remaining at our events then new membership approvals will be held until the club's members approve expansion.\n\nYou might've noticed a small detail there, about the club members approving something. The club is fully democratic; every year a committee is elected to steer the club but large, sweeping changes are voted on by all members at an AGM (Annual General Meeting). That means, as a member, you directly decide who you want to lead the club and vote on the big decisions.\n\nBut it's not just about hotels & meetings, as a club we aim to eventually bring additional benefits such as web & email hosting, skills sharing & workshops and more…\n\nMembership is just £5 per year whether you attend an event or not. For the first event the membership fee is included in the event ticket. If you’ve been invited but can’t attend our first event but would still like to join the club or future events you can still register just for membership.\n\n## Venue\nSeacote Hotel, St. Bees, West Cumbria 31st October 2025\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"hotel-image\">\n\n![Seacote Hotel Outside](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3JB8fXVjCblGcfeEy3NJp1/a6ccb0afa1ba82795c19ffad27b37853/Seacote_Hotel.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe have secured use of the Seacote Hotel in St. Bees. This is a traditional, large seaside hotel without the corporate vibe of modern conference facilities. They’ve got a large event space with bar & catering for us to have a great time in, as well as separate bar & restaurant areas you may use if you just need to get away from things for a bit.\n\nThe hotel is situated next to St. Bees beach which is fantastic for taking in the sea air or just going for a stroll. There’s ample car parking for everyone, and the nearest train station is just a 10-minute walk away.\n\n### Bedrooms\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"hotel-bedroom-images\">\n\n![Seacote Double Bedroom](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3bI7EoTL5p15W0TEFHZQPe/1a5fd1bc8e344af30e9664f17c549ef7/Double_Bedroom.jpg)\n![Seacote Twin Bedroom](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/vNOFzFsRbSjnlXwnsrRmT/54eb0da1b62c04ae11ae3d7b394d4b5a/Twin_Bedroom.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe’ve a variety of options for your stay which include single, double, twin, triple, and quad rooms. All are available on a first-come, first-served basis. If we’re unable to provide you with your first choice of room we will try to offer alternatives.\n\nAll rooms include en-suite facilities, Wi-Fi, TVs, towels & linen, and tea & coffee making facilities.\n\nDue to the nature of the hotel all of the rooms vary a little and aren’t cookie cutter copy & paste like chain hotels. But we hope you’ll agree that they all represent excellent value for money.\n\n### Food\nAll meals from Friday evening until Monday morning are included in your stay. We’ll be providing a lunch & dinner buffet  as well as breakfast. Dining options in the local area are limited so we’re sure you’ll appreciate not going hungry! Vegan & gluten-free options will also be provided but do be sure to let us know if you have any specific requirements so we can ensure you are catered for.\n\n## Cost\nAll prices are per-person based on a 3-night stay. Prices are based on maximum occupancy of the room. Prices include event entry, bed, breakfast (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday), lunch buffet (Saturday & Sunday), and dinner buffet (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).\n      - Single room: £350\n      - Double / Twin room: £260\n      - Triple room (1 double, 1 single): £240\n      - Quad room (1 double, 2 singles): £220\n\nPayment will be required either by April 6th or two weeks after your registration is approved, whichever is the later. If you need to delay payment please let us know and we’ll try to accommodate your needs as best as we’re able.\n\n### Additional nights\n\nNeed to arrive early or depart late? That can be arranged too. Please keep in mind that these nights are provided for convenience or to enable you to do some local sight seeing. All prices are based on maximum occupancy of rooms. The cost per-person of rooms will increase if beds are unoccupied. Prices are for bed & breakfast only; there will be no convention events operating outside of the Friday to Sunday period.\n- Single room: £78\n- Double / Twin room: £48\n- Triple room: £46\n- Quad room: £44\n\n### Room partners\nWant to share with someone that isn’t a member? You can invite them to join too! If you’re not sure who you’ll be sharing with yet, don’t worry; you don’t need to make an immediate decision. Once your membership is approved you can contact other members through our Telegram group to see if there’s anyone interested in being a room mate.\n\n## Entertainments\nAlthough we don’t have the space & facilities to provide an event to the same scale as NFC or CFz we will ensure the events are entertaining and provide you with lasting memories (hopefully for the right reasons). During the weekend there are plans afoot for the following:\n* Casino games (no money involved)\n* Pub quiz\n* Pumpkin carving competition\n* Karaoke & dance nights\n* Fursuit games\n* Movie showing\n* Boardgame spaces\n* Photography opportunities\n* Special interest panels\n\n### Dealers den\nWe will evaluate demand for this during registration. If one occurs it will be an opportunity for dealers to trade for a couple of hours during the daytime. Our members site will also contain a directory of dealers that are members of the club.\n\n### Fursuit lounge\nThe lounge area will be a simple side room from the primary event space providing fans, water & light snacks.\n\n### Even more...\nMembers will be invited to run their own panels or stage performances.\n\n## Getting involved\nOnce your membership is approved we’ll provide you with invites into our Telegram group so you can meet other members.\n\n## Further questions\nIf there’s anything else you’d like to know please get in touch, your primary inviter will either be able to answer your questions or pass them on to the committee to address.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"bg-sky-700 text-white font-bold mx-auto p-1 rounded text-center text-lg w-40\">\n\n[Register Now!](https://reg.furrific.uk)\n\u003C/div>",".hotel-bedroom-images p {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n.hotel-bedroom-images img {\n  margin: 1rem;\n  min-width: 100px;\n  max-width: 400px;\n}\n.hotel-image p {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n.hotel-image img {\n  margin: 1rem;\n  min-width: 200px;\n  max-width: 800px;\n}\n\n.content-index .text-white a {\n  color: white;\n}",{"data":346,"body":348,"excerpt":-1,"toc":708},{"title":347,"description":347},"",{"type":349,"children":350},"root",[351],{"type":352,"tag":353,"props":354,"children":357},"element","div",{"className":355},[356],"content-index",[358,365,391,398,403,408,413,418,423,428,433,439,444,458,463,468,475,493,498,503,508,514,519,525,530,535,541,546,571,577,582,588,593,641,647,652,658,663,669,674,680,685,691,696],{"type":352,"tag":359,"props":360,"children":362},"h1",{"id":361},"a-furightful-gathering",[363],{"type":364,"value":342},"text",{"type":352,"tag":353,"props":366,"children":377},{"className":367},[368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376],"bg-sky-700","text-white","font-bold","mx-auto","p-1","rounded","text-center","text-lg","w-40",[378],{"type":352,"tag":379,"props":380,"children":381},"p",{},[382],{"type":352,"tag":383,"props":384,"children":388},"a",{"href":385,"rel":386},"https://reg.furrific.uk",[387],"nofollow",[389],{"type":364,"value":390},"Register Now!",{"type":352,"tag":392,"props":393,"children":395},"h2",{"id":394},"welcome-to-the-club",[396],{"type":364,"value":397},"Welcome to the Club",{"type":352,"tag":379,"props":399,"children":400},{},[401],{"type":364,"value":402},"If you're reading this it means you've likely received an invite to join us in a new adventure.
