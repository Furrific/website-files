Furrific isn't just another convention but a members-only club. Membership is deliberately limited to retain an old-school, small convention vibe in which you can walk into a room and feel surrounded by friends from afar.\n\nThe club is kicking off with its first event at the Seacote Hotel in St. Bees. We'll have a full line up of events just as you'd expect with a small convention. It won't be too heavy and there'll be plenty of time to simply relax and socialise.\n\nEvery member is invited to be involved as much or little as they would like, all contributions are welcome.\n\nAs a members club all new members must be invited by two existing members that act as their referees before being approved by committee. If we no longer have capacity remaining at our events then new membership approvals will be held until the club's members approve expansion.\n\nYou might've noticed a small detail there, about the club members approving something. The club is fully democratic; every year a committee is elected to steer the club but large, sweeping changes are voted on by all members at an AGM (Annual General Meeting). That means, as a member, you directly decide who you want to lead the club and vote on the big decisions.\n\nBut it's not just about hotels & meetings, as a club we aim to eventually bring additional benefits such as web & email hosting, skills sharing & workshops and more…\n\nMembership is just £5 per year whether you attend an event or not. For the first event the membership fee is included in the event ticket. If you’ve been invited but can’t attend our first event but would still like to join the club or future events you can still register just for membership.\n\n## Venue\n\nSeacote Hotel, St. Bees, West Cumbria 31st October 2025\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"hotel-image\">\n\n![Seacote Hotel Outside](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3JB8fXVjCblGcfeEy3NJp1/a6ccb0afa1ba82795c19ffad27b37853/Seacote_Hotel.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe have secured use of the Seacote Hotel in St. Bees. This is a traditional, large seaside hotel without the corporate vibe of modern conference facilities. They’ve got a large event space with bar & catering for us to have a great time in, as well as separate bar & restaurant areas you may use if you just need to get away from things for a bit.\n\nThe hotel is situated next to St. Bees beach which is fantastic for taking in the sea air or just going for a stroll. There’s ample car parking for everyone, and the nearest train station is just a 10-minute walk away.\n\n### Bedrooms\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"hotel-bedroom-images\">\n\n![Seacote Double Bedroom](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3bI7EoTL5p15W0TEFHZQPe/1a5fd1bc8e344af30e9664f17c549ef7/Double_Bedroom.jpg)\n![Seacote Twin Bedroom](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/vNOFzFsRbSjnlXwnsrRmT/54eb0da1b62c04ae11ae3d7b394d4b5a/Twin_Bedroom.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe’ve a variety of options for your stay which include single, double, twin, triple, and quad rooms.

Check out our daily timetables below to see what you could be getting up to.\n\n- [Friday Timetable](//assets.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/6WU8YW5279gc4xoa79fDlu/9c185f3a8d178ad1c170b300f2129868/Events_Friday.pdf)\n- [Saturday Timetable](//assets.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/ObXDwXZYnemTYeCFD2MlZ/23cbdd1ed9a9298c981356d266567e7c/Events_Saturday.pdf)\n- [Sunday Timetable](//assets.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/3yFPE9svyD8NMjgJf8ssWf/6df39c8b4cfa3e616c445d0a4cf3c254/Events_Sunday.pdf)\n\n### Fursuit lounge\n\nThe lounge area will be a simple side room from the primary event space providing fans, water & light snacks.\n\n## Travel\n\nThere are a number of ways to get to St. Bees. Whether you're travelling in by road, rail, or air, our recommendations for how to reach us are below.\n\n### By Car\n\nFor satnavs, the postcode for the Seacote Hotel is CA27 0ES. However, we would strongly considering the following routes when planning and embarking on your journey.\n\n__From the South:__ Use M6 junction 40 (Penrith), then A66 West, then A595 South. We strongly advise against using M6 junction 36, as the road between there and St. Bees is very poor. Although longer, you will find exiting at junction 40 to be quicker and easier overall.\n\n__From the North:__ Use M6 junction 44 (Carlisle), then A595 South.\n\n__From the East:__ Use A1(M) junction 53 (Scotch Corner), then A66 West, then A595 South.\n\n__All Routes, Once on the A595 South:__ Travel as far as Whitehaven. On exiting Whitehaven look out for a right turn on to Mirehouse Road, which should be signposted as a route for St. Bees. At the end of this road there is a T-junction. Turn left here and follow the B5345 (St. Bees Road). After almost 2 miles, just after entering St. Bees, the road turns sharply left. Here, take the right turn, which is essentially driving straight on rather than taking the turn, and follow Abbey Road. After a further half-mile you will see the Seacote Hotel Car Park on your left with the hotel behind it.\n\n### Car Parking\n\nOnly certain parking spaces around the hotel are for use by hotel residents. Please make sure you park in these spaces and display the parking permit that will be provided to you when you check into the hotel. The diagram below shows which spaces are for hotel residents; please park in the area highlighted in green. Parking without displaying the permit or parking in any other area without a pay & display ticket may result in you receiving a fine, so be sure to check that you are parked in a valid space!\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"parking-image\">\n\n![Car Parking](//images.ctfassets.net/6ujs3kwlc75h/2cFs4cFJihnBgTvMwEle3x/12aa3c0a9a6746668c1586d62cac531f/Furrific_Parking.jpg)\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Vehicle Recharging & Refuelling\n\n__Electric Vehicles:__ There are a number of electric vehicle charging points in Whitehaven, about five miles away from our venue. Morrisons have a number available – the postcode for this site is CA28 7RQ.\n\n__Petrol & Diesel Vehicles:__ There are a number of petrol stations in Whitehaven. Both Morrisons and Tesco have one and the postcodes for these sites are CA28 7RW and CA28 7XY respectively.\n\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee the operation or availability of the above services!\n\n### By Train\n\nSt. Bees has its own train station with an easy 10-15 minute walk (0.6 miles) to the Seacote Hotel. The train station is on the Cumbrian Coast Line with connections to the West Coast Main Line at Carlisle and Lancaster.\n\nFrom the Train Station: From the main entrance to the train station, take a left turn on to Main Street, then turn left again after 50m onto Station Road. Follow this road for 500m and it will merge with Beach Road. Continue to follow Beach Road for another 300m and you should come to the Seacote Hotel Car Park on the left with the hotel behind it.\n\nIf you reach the larger Beachfront Car Park or your feet become wet because you have entered the sea, you have gone too far and need to retrace your steps.\n\n### By Air\n\nManchester Airport is generally the best option and offers several connections to the train routes above with a journey time of about four to five hours. It is approximately three hours drive from St. Bees.\n\nGlasgow Airport offers fewer connections to the train routes above and will require a bus ride to Glasgow Central station with an overall journey time of about four and a half hours. It is approximately three hours drive from St. Bees\n\nEdinburgh Airport offers fewer connections to the train routes above and will require a bus ride to Haymarket Station with an over journey time of about four and a half hours. It is approximately three and a half hours drive from St. Bees.\n\nWhile a popular route into the UK, London Heathrow Airport is not recommended as this will require multiple London Underground and National Rail services with a journey time of about seven to eight hours. It is also a drive of over six hours from St. Bees.\n\n### By… Air?\n\nIf you have a helicopter… can we have a lift?\n\n## Getting involved\n\nOnce your membership is approved we’ll provide you with invites into our Telegram group so you can meet other members.\n\n## Further questions\n\nIf there’s anything else you’d like to know please get in touch, your primary inviter will either be able to answer your questions or pass them on to the committee to address.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"bg-sky-700 text-white font-bold mx-auto p-1 rounded text-center text-lg w-40\">\n\n[Register Now!](https://reg.furrific.uk)\n\u003C/div>",".hotel-bedroom-images p {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n.hotel-bedroom-images img {\n  margin: 1rem;\n  min-width: 100px;\n  max-width: 400px;\n}\n.hotel-image p {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n.hotel-image img {\n  margin: 1rem;\n  min-width: 200px;\n  max-width: 800px;\n}\n.parking-image p {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n.parking-image img {\n  margin: 1rem;\n  min-width: 200px;\n  max-width: 800px;\n}\n.content-index .text-white a {\n  color: white;\n}",{"data":8,"body":10,"excerpt":-1,"toc":523},{"title":9,"description":9},"",{"type":11,"children":12},"root",[13],{"type":14,"tag":15,"props":16,"children":19},"element","div",{"className":17},[18],"content-index",[20,27,53,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,101,106,120,125,130,137,155,160,165,170,176,181,186,191,196,202,207,212,218,223,248,254,259,265,270,303,309,314,320,325,331,336,347,357,367,377,383,388,400,406,416,426,431,437,442,447,452,458,463,468,473,478,484,489,495,500,506,511],{"type":14,"tag":21,"props":22,"children":24},"h1",{"id":23},"a-furightful-gathering",[25],{"type":26,"value":4},"text",{"type":14,"tag":15,"props":28,"children":39},{"className":29},[30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38],"bg-sky-700","text-white","font-bold","mx-auto","p-1","rounded","text-center","text-lg","w-40",[40],{"type":14,"tag":41,"props":42,"children":43},"p",{},[44],{"type":14,"tag":45,"props":46,"children":50},"a",{"href":47,"rel":48},"https://reg.furrific.uk",[49],"nofollow",[51],{"type":26,"value":52},"Register Now!",{"type":14,"tag":54,"props":55,"children":57},"h2",{"id":56},"welcome-to-the-club",[58],{"type":26,"value":59},"Welcome to the Club",{"type":14,"tag":41,"props":61,"children":62},{},[63],{"type":26,"value":64},"If you're reading this it means you've likely received an invite to join us in a new adventure.

This fandom is known for its diverse and vibrant community, creative expression, and various activities centered around these anthropomorphic characters.\n\n### Key aspects of the furry fandom\n\n#### Inclusivity\n\n* **Sexuality**: The furry fandom has always been a strong safe-space for gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual & asexual members. It is welcoming to everyone regardless of how you identify.\n* **Gender**: More members than ever now identify as trans or gender non-conforming. The furry fandom creates an environment is which its members feel safe to be the people they truly are.\n* **Neurodivergent**: Be it autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or any of many other cognitive differences; the furry fandom knows how to embrace these traits in people and is stronger for it.\n\n#### Art and creativity\n\n* **Artwork**: One of the most prominent features of the furry fandom is the creation and sharing of artwork depicting anthropomorphic animals. This includes illustrations, digital art, comics, and animations.\n* **Literature and Music**: In addition to visual art, the fandom also includes writers and musicians who create works featuring anthropomorphic characters.\n* **Fursuits**: Some members create or commission elaborate costumes, called fursuits, that represent their anthropomorphic animal personas, or \"fursonas\".\n\n#### Fursonas\n\n* **Definition**: A fursona is a personalised anthropomorphic animal character created by a member of the furry fandom. It often reflects aspects of the person's personality, interests, or aspirations.\n* **Representation**: Fursonas can vary widely in species, appearance, and backstory, and they serve as avatars for interaction within the community.\n\n#### Conventions and gatherings:\n\n* **Conventions**: Large-scale events, such as Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, and Eurofurence, provide a space for fans to meet, share their work, participate in panels, and attend dances and other social events.\n* **Meetups**: Smaller, local gatherings and meetups also take place, providing more intimate settings for fans to connect.\n\n#### Online communities:\n\n* **Forums and Social Media**: The furry fandom has a significant online presence through forums, social media platforms, and dedicated websites like FurAffinity and DeviantArt.\n* **Roleplaying and Gaming**: Many fans engage in online roleplaying games, creating stories and scenarios for their fursonas.\n\n#### Diverse interests:\n\n* **Broad Backgrounds**: Members of the fandom come from virtually every walk of life, meaning almost any interest or hobby will find a home within the fandom.\n* **Charity Work**: Many furry conventions and events incorporate charity fundraisers, supporting various causes.\n\nThe furry fandom is a vibrant and creative community that celebrates anthropomorphic animal characters. Through art, conventions, online interactions, and personal expression, members connect over their shared interests and contribute to a rich and multifaceted subculture.\n\n::","2024-08-08T00:00+01:00",{"metadata":647,"sys":650,"fields":659},{"tags":648,"concepts":649},[],[],{"space":651,"id":653,"type":567,"createdAt":654,"updatedAt":654,"environment":655,"publishedVersion":530,"revision":552,"contentType":657,"locale":579},{"sys":652},{"type":563,"linkType":564,"id":565},"3chVNlFEzUwRu6LLRE59s9","2025-02-13T17:29:16.774Z",{"sys":656},{"id":572,"type":563,"linkType":573},{"sys":658},{"type":563,"linkType":577,"id":597},{"title":660,"link":661},"Events",{"metadata":662,"sys":665,"fields":677},{"tags":663,"concepts":664},[],[],{"space":666,"id":668,"type":567,"createdAt":669,"updatedAt":670,"environment":671,"publishedVersion":673,"revision":674,"contentType":675,"locale":579},{"sys":667},{"type":563,"linkType":564,"id":565},"6BTZml8MTqQkpoPQbDOadi","2024-08-10T12:20:09.119Z","2025-02-24T00:26:09.341Z",{"sys":672},{"id":572,"type":563,"linkType":573},340,16,{"sys":676},{"type":563,"linkType":577,"id":615},{"title":660,"slug":678,"body":679,"publishDate":680},"/events","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n## 31st October 2025: West Cumbria\n\nThis is a private, invite-only event being held in West Cumbria.

It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to support your application.\n\n## What next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by its members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee-assigned role stands down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to, even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited-by-guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with UK regulation and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on and only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach of legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[797],"general",{"metadata":799,"sys":802,"fields":812},{"tags":800,"concepts":801},[],[],{"space":803,"id":805,"type":567,"createdAt":806,"updatedAt":806,"environment":807,"publishedVersion":809,"revision":552,"contentType":810,"locale":579},{"sys":804},{"type":563,"linkType":564,"id":565},"5rbKJTXOGsSBlajvb0y8xu","2025-05-19T15:33:39.108Z",{"sys":808},{"id":572,"type":563,"linkType":573},5,{"sys":811},{"type":563,"linkType":577,"id":597},{"title":813,"link":814},"Contact Information",{"metadata":815,"sys":818,"fields":830},{"tags":816,"concepts":817},[],[],{"space":819,"id":821,"type":567,"createdAt":822,"updatedAt":823,"environment":824,"publishedVersion":826,"revision":827,"contentType":828,"locale":579},{"sys":820},{"type":563,"linkType":564,"id":565},"2YH4YXNFUP8j2x8LmkDLpq","2025-05-15T20:15:56.476Z","2025-05-21T19:14:57.481Z",{"sys":825},{"id":572,"type":563,"linkType":573},147,21,{"sys":829},{"type":563,"linkType":577,"id":615},{"title":831,"slug":832,"body":833,"publishDate":834},"Contact Us","/contact-us","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# Contact Information\n\nFurrific is operated by a team is made up of passionate members who dedicate their free time and energy throughout the year.\n\nGot a question, idea, encountered a problem, or just want to get in touch?

By registering for the club and it's events you agree to be bound by all of the following terms and conditions.\n\nFailure to adhere to the points below may result in your club membership being withdrawn, your removal from events.\n\nWith this in mind, please ensure that you read the following terms and conditions carefully and completely before accepting them.\n\n## Requirement of Membership\n\n* In order to be a member of Furrific you must be 18 years of age or older.\n* You must read, accept, and abide by the club's Code of Conduct & Constitution. The Code contains both general principles and more specific standards of behaviour that are expected of our members. If you breach any part of the Code of Conduct, your membership (and accommodation bookings or event bookings, if any) may be cancelled. With this in mind, please ensure you read the Code carefully and completely.\n* To receive your membership badge, which provides access to the event and activities therein, you must provide valid and in-date ID during on site registration. The ID provided must be government issued or bear the PASS holographic logo, it must also contain your photograph, your legal name, and your date of birth. These must all match the details provided to us during the online registration process. Please note that the ID should be in your legal name. If you are in the process of changing name you will need to provide government issued documentation to support this (e.g. Gender recognition certificate).\n* Failure to provide valid, in-date ID that meets the above criteria will render you unable to register for and participate in the club and its events and you may be asked to leave the venue.\n* You must make Furrific Ltd and it's first-aid team aware of any medical conditions that may require special care. Any such information provided will only be used by the first-aid team on duty to ensure that any emergency relating to your medical condition is handled appropriately.\n* Some events or activities may have additional Terms and Conditions, you must abide by these if participating in such events or activities.\n* All final decisions with regard to club policies, procedures, and their implementation lie with the Furrific committee.\n\n## Your Membership\n\n* All events and membership options are subject to availability.\n* If you are opting for a residential option at an event, it is your responsibility to arrange another member to share the room with where applicable.\n* Once we have reviewed your registration and sent a confirmation to you via your chosen email address, you will be requested to pay the full amount of the registration fee. Should you fail to pay when requested, your registration may be cancelled and any place at the event lost. If you are struggling to pay your registration on time, please contact our team at registration@furrific.uk to review your options.\n* Equally, if your room share partner does not pay their registration fee on time, your room booking may be at risk. Please contact our registration team at registration@furrific.uk immediately if this is the case.\n* If you are a participant in a room share for which the other person is the leader, their room choice will override any that you have made and neither Furrific Ltd, the event venues, or any other entity will be responsible if this does not meet with your expectations or requirements. Please communicate clearly with your chosen room partner and agree on your requirements in advance.\n* You agree to the terms and conditions of whichever payment provider you use in order to complete payment of membership & event registration fees.\n* Once your registration for the club & any events is confirmed and paid we may be unable to refund this if you subsequently wish to cancel your membership or attendance.\n* You may be given the opportunity to upload an image to represent yourself on your membership badge. By using this functionality you bestow upon us the right to reproduce the image for the sole purpose of adding it to your membership badge and that you have the right to do so. The club may, at its discretion, decline an image should it be considered offensive or could bring the club into disrepute.\n\n## Cancellations\n\n* Furrific Ltd is not responsible for circumstances beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, or terrorism, extreme weather conditions, pandemic, or government action. Furrific Ltd reserves the right to cancel events with no warning in these circumstances.\n* In the event that an event is cancelled, Furrific Ltd will offer members refunds to the amount possible given expenses already incurred directly and with respect to commitments. By registering you accept both this and the possibility that, should the cancellation occur at a late enough point, such refunds may not be 100% and could in fact be zero.\n\n## Events\n\n* Event venues are private property and they have the right to refuse entry for any reason.\n* Service animals are permitted, for pets permission must be sought from the club committee and are only permitted where venues allow.\n* You must respect the wishes and follow any reasonable instructions of both venue staff, the club's event team, and any security personnel.\n* You agree to read the safety plans provided by venues in case of fire or other emergencies and to follow the rules implemented by the venue for these scenarios if they occur.\n* If you are not the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the event venue, you are not permitted to remain in the event spaces, communal areas, or venue rooms overnight and must leave the venue each day as soon as the last event or dance concludes. Attempting to stay in the venue overnight in contravention of this rule is strictly forbidden. The venue may seek to recover costs in these cases and the club will not be liable for covering these costs.\n* If you are the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the venue, you must not permit any non-residential member to stay in your hotel room overnight.\n* Any instance of the above that is discovered may lead to the removal of both the non-residential person from the event and any other members discovered to be facilitating this action. No refund will be given for ticket or accommodation in these cases, nor any other form of remuneration. At the discretion of committee, such instances may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the club or future events.\n* If you participate in any club auctions and submit a bid for an item on sale, you are entering a contract of commitment to pay the bid amount on completion of the auction in the event that you are the winning bidder.\n* Any care delivered by our first-aid team is given on a “best efforts” basis. The club and its teams volunteers are not responsible for any damage to property sustained while such care is delivered.\n* While reasonable effort is taken to ensure to avoid such incidents, by attending the event you may be exposed to allergens of various forms. Furrific UK Ltd, it's event venues, nor any other associated entity are not responsible for any injury or damage resulting from such exposure.\n\n## Your Property\n\n* Furrific Ltd and it's event hosts are not responsible for any of your property that is lost, stolen or damaged; this remains your responsibility at all times and includes any vehicle left in the venue car park, which is parked at your own risk. Please take all reasonable precautions to secure your vehicle and property.\n* If you choose to use the fursuit facilities at events, neither Furrific Ltd, the event venue, or any other entity can be held responsible for any damage to or loss of property sustained.\n* If you choose to participate in any activity at the event while wearing a costume of any kind, Furrific and the venue, nor any other entity, can be held responsible for any damage that it sustains.\n\n## Website & Provided Information\n\n* Data that you enter into our membership / event registration system will be protected as described in our Privacy Policy and in accordance with the Data Protection Act.

However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to technically deliver the service and we will ensure that they will be required to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.\n\nWe will not release your information to third parties unless, as stated above, you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.\nIf you have any questions regarding secure transactions, please contact us via email at [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk).\n\n## Your choices and updating information\nIt is your choice whether or not you wish to receive information from us; generally all contact from us will be related to the direct delivery of membership services, including any events that Furrific may operate. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given your prior consent for this. If you wish to change your preferences after selecting them at any time, please email us at [privacy-25@furrfic.uk](mailto:privacy-25@furrfic.uk).\n\nGenerally, to update the details that we hold for you, you will need to log in to our [registration system](https://reg.furrific.uk/) and amend your details accordingly. Should the system be closed please contact the club secretary and we will seek to update this in your place.\n\nShould you require a copy of the information held about you we may charge a reasonable administrative fee if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repeated following previous requests.\n\n## Security precautions used\n\nWe use a wide range of appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard access to, and use of, your personal information and to ensure it retains its integrity and availability. These include structured access controls to systems, network protection, intrusion detection, physical access controls, and staff training. We also consider anonymising or pseudonymising personal data where practical. Sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) will not be held by us and payment service providers will be expected to use encryption and protection to the highest standards.\n\nOnce we receive your information we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems and only retain data as long as required for the purposes of processing or legal requirements. Password access will be used internally which should be kept secret and not disclosed to others, if you have a password to allow access to certain areas of our website we would advise you keep this safe and secure.\n\n## Website cookies\nMost websites use cookies which are small text files that are placed on your device for various purposes including improving site functionality and facilitating various services.
