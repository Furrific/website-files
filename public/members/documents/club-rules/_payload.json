All members of the community are expected to adhere to and uphold these rules.\n\n## How Our Rules Work\nWe want to keep things simple at Furrific, while also making sure our members feel their expectations are managed appropriately. Therefore, rather than having a long and prescriptive code of conduct that attempts to cover every eventuality and which is difficult to remember every detail of, our rules are primarily principle based and largely common sense.\n\nInterpretation of the rules will be down to the Furrific Committee and their judgement will be considered final. In this way, we hope to keep the burden of reading and understanding these rules low, while also providing clarity and flexibility in their application to match any given situation.\n\n## The Rules\n__Respect:__ Be excellent to each other.\n\n__Responsibility:__ We expect all members to behave responsibly and not act in any way that may threaten to bring Furrific into disrepute.\n\n__Inclusivity:__ We have zero tolerance for harassment and discrimination of any kind.\n\n__Consent:__ Members are expected to have clear consent for activities with others, be it photographs, physical contact, or any other situations.\n\n__Safety:__ Safety comes first, at our events members are expected to prioritise the wellbeing of themselves and others.\n\n__Appearance:__ When attending our events, members are expected to maintain appropriate standards of dress. Generally, this includes avoiding excessive nudity and gear commonly regarded as fetish wear.\n\n__Weapons & Props:__ Props that could be mistaken for or used as weapons must be peace bonded. Instructions on how to do this will be provided at each event. Actual weaponry of any kind is not permitted at our events.\n\n__Clarity:__ If in doubt, or if you require clarification on any of these principles and how they may apply to a specific situation, please email secretary@furrfic.uk.\n\n__Enforcement:__ Breaches of our rules will be reviewed by the Furrific Committee on a case-by-case basis and, depending on their severity, nature, and repetition, may result in a warning, removal from an event, or temporary or permanent exclusion from the Furrific members’ club in accordance to article 3.5 of the constitution.\n",{"data":7,"body":9,"excerpt":-1,"toc":167},{"title":8,"description":8},"",{"type":10,"children":11},"root",[12],{"type":13,"tag":14,"props":15,"children":18},"element","div",{"className":16},[17],"content-index",[19,27,33,40,45,51,56,61,67,78,88,98,108,118,128,138,157],{"type":13,"tag":20,"props":21,"children":23},"h1",{"id":22},"furrific-club-rules",[24],{"type":25,"value":26},"text","Furrific Club Rules",{"type":13,"tag":28,"props":29,"children":30},"p",{},[31],{"type":25,"value":32},"V1.0 – Published 23/02/2025",{"type":13,"tag":34,"props":35,"children":37},"h2",{"id":36},"what-is-this-document",[38],{"type":25,"value":39},"What is this document?",{"type":13,"tag":28,"props":41,"children":42},{},[43],{"type":25,"value":44},"This document sets out the general rules of conduct and behaviour that is expected of Furrific members, both generally within our community and at any events that we may run.

This fandom is known for its diverse and vibrant community, creative expression, and various activities centered around these anthropomorphic characters.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Furry Fandom\n\n#### Inclusivity\n\n* **Sexuality**: The furry fandom has always been a strong safe-space for gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual & asexual members. It is welcoming to everyone regardless of how you identify.\n* **Gender**: More members than ever now identify as trans or gender non-conforming. The furry fandom creates an environment is which it's members feel safe to be the people they truly are.\n* **Neurodivergent**: Be it autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia any many other cognitive differences; the furry fandom knows how to embrace these traits in people and is stronger for it.\n\n#### Art and Creativity\n\n* **Artwork**: One of the most prominent features of the furry fandom is the creation and sharing of artwork depicting anthropomorphic animals. This includes illustrations, digital art, comics, and animations.\n* **Fursuits**: Some members create or commission elaborate costumes, called fursuits, that represent their anthropomorphic animal personas, or \"fursonas.\"\n\n#### Fursonas\n\n* **Definition**: A fursona is a personalized anthropomorphic animal character created by a member of the furry fandom. It often reflects aspects of the person's personality, interests, or aspirations.\n* **Representation**: Fursonas can vary widely in species, appearance, and backstory, and they serve as avatars for interaction within the community.\n\n#### Conventions and Gatherings:\n\n* **Conventions**: Large-scale events, such as Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, and Eurofurence, provide a space for fans to meet, share their work, participate in panels, and attend dances and other social events.\n* **Meetups**: Smaller, local gatherings and meetups also take place, providing more intimate settings for fans to connect.\n\n#### Online Communities:\n\n* **Forums and Social Media**: The furry fandom has a significant online presence through forums, social media platforms, and dedicated websites like Fur Affinity and DeviantArt.\n* **Role-Playing and Gaming**: Many fans engage in online role-playing games, creating stories and scenarios for their fursonas.\n\n#### Diverse Interests:\n\n* **Literature and Music**: In addition to visual art, the fandom also includes writers and musicians who create works featuring anthropomorphic characters.\n* **Charity Work**: Many furry conventions and events incorporate charity fundraisers, supporting various causes.\n\nThe furry fandom is a vibrant and creative community that celebrates anthropomorphic animal characters. Through art, conventions, online interactions, and personal expression, members connect over their shared interests and contribute to a rich and multifaceted subculture.\n\n::","2024-08-08T00:00+01:00",{"metadata":272,"sys":275,"fields":284},{"tags":273,"concepts":274},[],[],{"space":276,"id":278,"type":191,"createdAt":279,"updatedAt":279,"environment":280,"publishedVersion":199,"revision":176,"contentType":282,"locale":204},{"sys":277},{"type":187,"linkType":188,"id":189},"3chVNlFEzUwRu6LLRE59s9","2025-02-13T17:29:16.774Z",{"sys":281},{"id":196,"type":187,"linkType":197},{"sys":283},{"type":187,"linkType":202,"id":222},{"title":285,"link":286},"Events",{"metadata":287,"sys":290,"fields":302},{"tags":288,"concepts":289},[],[],{"space":291,"id":293,"type":191,"createdAt":294,"updatedAt":295,"environment":296,"publishedVersion":298,"revision":299,"contentType":300,"locale":204},{"sys":292},{"type":187,"linkType":188,"id":189},"6BTZml8MTqQkpoPQbDOadi","2024-08-10T12:20:09.119Z","2025-02-13T17:00:34.117Z",{"sys":297},{"id":196,"type":187,"linkType":197},302,14,{"sys":301},{"type":187,"linkType":202,"id":241},{"title":285,"slug":303,"body":304,"publishDate":305},"/events","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n## West Cumbria 31st Oct 2025\n\nThis is a private invite only event being held in West Cumbria.

It is operated primarily by an elected voluntary committee of members.\n\n## How do I join?\n\nTo become a member you must be introduced by two existing members (a nominee & seconder). Membership spaces are limited so you may be entered onto a waiting list. Your application will then be reviewed by existing members giving them opportunity to either approve or reject. If you pass the review process you will be formally invited to join the club.\n\nIf you don't know any existing members you may still apply and existing members may choose to back your application.\n\n## What Next?\n\nExisting members are informed of your application to join the club, and you\nwill need to agree to basic personal details being shared with them for this to\nhappen. Typically, this will be just your Furry name and links to any social\nmedia presence.\n\nMembership applications are discussed and voted on, if approved you will be admitted into the club.\n\n## Membership Fees\n\nIf you attend any event during the year, the event fee covers your membership. If\nyou wish to retain membership without attending an event there is a £5 charge.\n\n## Who's in charge?\n\nEveryone! The club is fundamentally operated by it's members. We hold an AGM where members elect the operating committee for the coming year. At the AGM anyone currently holding a committee position or committee assigned role stands-down and must be re-elected if they wish to continue in that role.\n\nAll members are encouraged to get involved and lend a hand however they wish to even if they're not interested in being on the committee. Members lending a hand are referred to as Furrific Fellows.\n\n## What about the Directors?\n\nThe directors are required in order for the club to exist as a limited by guarantee company. Their main interest is ensuring legal compliance with the UK government and overseeing core administrative and financial tasks. Their powers are mostly delegated to the committee which they also hold a position on, they only veto decisions in matters where there would be a conflict of interest or a breach in legislation.\n\n::\n","2017-05-15T00:00+02:00",[419],"general",{"metadata":421,"sys":424,"fields":434},{"tags":422,"concepts":423},[],[],{"space":425,"id":427,"type":191,"createdAt":428,"updatedAt":429,"environment":430,"publishedVersion":198,"revision":168,"contentType":432,"locale":204},{"sys":426},{"type":187,"linkType":188,"id":189},"2uQKKZh9W5YCmJqVhwtb89","2025-02-13T17:41:06.639Z","2025-02-13T18:53:22.150Z",{"sys":431},{"id":196,"type":187,"linkType":197},{"sys":433},{"type":187,"linkType":202,"id":222},{"title":435,"link":436},"Terms and Conditions",{"metadata":437,"sys":440,"fields":451},{"tags":438,"concepts":439},[],[],{"space":441,"id":443,"type":191,"createdAt":444,"updatedAt":445,"environment":446,"publishedVersion":448,"revision":198,"contentType":449,"locale":204},{"sys":442},{"type":187,"linkType":188,"id":189},"2utBAXLZGRYfQERXhb0zWd","2025-01-22T02:27:37.666Z","2025-02-16T22:25:32.311Z",{"sys":447},{"id":196,"type":187,"linkType":197},263,{"sys":450},{"type":187,"linkType":202,"id":241},{"title":435,"slug":452,"body":453,"publishDate":305},"/legal/terms-and-conditions","::div{class=\"content-index\"}\n\n# Terms and Conditions\n\n## Definitions\n\n\"You\", \"member\", \"your\", and \"yourself\" relate to the person agreeing to these terms and conditions. “We”, \"our\", “Furrific”, \"club\" and “event” relate to the Furrific members club which is brought to you by the registered company, Furrific UK Ltd, company number 15666730, with registered address of Unit A, 82 James Carter Road, Mildenhall, United Kingdom, IP28 7DE.\n\n## What is this Document?\n\nThis document sets out the terms of conditions for membership and attendance of Furrific events.

The Code contains both general principles and more specific standards of behaviour that are expected of our members. If you breach any part of the Code of Conduct, your membership (and accommodation bookings or event bookings, if any) may be cancelled. With this in mind, please ensure you read the Code carefully and completely.\n* To receive your membership badge, which provides access to the event and activities therein, you must provide valid and in-date ID during on site registration. The ID provided must be government issued or bear the PASS holographic logo, it must also contain your photograph, your legal name, and your date of birth. These must all match the details provided to us during the online registration process. Please note that the ID should be in your legal name. If you are in the process of changing name you will need to provide government issued documentation to support this (e.g. Gender recognition certificate).\n* Failure to provide valid, in-date ID that meets the above criteria will render you unable to register for and participate in the club and its events and you may be asked to leave the venue.\n* You must make Furrific Ltd and it's first-aid team aware of any medical conditions that may require special care. Any such information provided will only be used by the first-aid team on duty to ensure that any emergency relating to your medical condition is handled appropriately.\n* Some events or activities may have additional Terms and Conditions, you must abide by these if participating in such events or activities.\n* All final decisions with regard to club policies, procedures, and their implementation lie with the Furrific committee.\n\n## Your Membership\n\n* All events and membership options are subject to availability.\n* If you are opting for a residential option at an event, it is your responsibility to arrange another member to share the room with where applicable.\n* Once we have reviewed your registration and sent a confirmation to you via your chosen email address, you will be requested to pay the full amount of the registration fee. Should you fail to pay when requested, your registration may be cancelled and any place at the event lost. If you are struggling to pay your registration on time, please contact our team at registration@furrific.uk to review your options.\n* Equally, if your room share partner does not pay their registration fee on time, your room booking may be at risk. Please contact our registration team at registration@furrific.uk immediately if this is the case.\n* If you are a participant in a room share for which the other person is the leader, their room choice will override any that you have made and neither Furrific Ltd, the event venues, or any other entity will be responsible if this does not meet with your expectations or requirements. Please communicate clearly with your chosen room partner and agree on your requirements in advance.\n* You agree to the terms and conditions of whichever payment provider you use in order to complete payment of membership & event registration fees.\n* Once your registration for the club & any events is confirmed and paid we may be unable to refund this if you subsequently wish to cancel your membership or attendance.\n* You may be given the opportunity to upload an image to represent yourself on your membership badge. By using this functionality you bestow upon us the right to reproduce the image for the sole purpose of adding it to your membership badge and that you have the right to do so. The club may, at its discretion, decline an image should it be considered offensive or could bring the club into disrepute.\n\n## Cancellations\n\n* Furrific Ltd is not responsible for circumstances beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, or terrorism, extreme weather conditions, pandemic, or government action. Furrific Ltd reserves the right to cancel events with no warning in these circumstances.\n* In the event that an event is cancelled, Furrific Ltd will offer members refunds to the amount possible given expenses already incurred directly and with respect to commitments. By registering you accept both this and the possibility that, should the cancellation occur at a late enough point, such refunds may not be 100% and could in fact be zero.\n\n## Events\n\n* Event venues are private property and they have the right to refuse entry for any reason.\n* Service animals are permitted, for pets permission must be sought from the club committee and are only permitted where venues allow.\n* You must respect the wishes and follow any reasonable instructions of both venue staff, the club's event team, and any security personnel.\n* You agree to read the safety plans provided by venues in case of fire or other emergencies and to follow the rules implemented by the venue for these scenarios if they occur.\n* If you are not the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the event venue, you are not permitted to remain in the event spaces, communal areas, or venue rooms overnight and must leave the venue each day as soon as the last event or dance concludes. Attempting to stay in the venue overnight in contravention of this rule is strictly forbidden. The venue may seek to recover costs in these cases and the club will not be liable for covering these costs.\n* If you are the holder of a residential booking including accommodation at the venue, you must not permit any non-residential member to stay in your hotel room overnight.\n* Any instance of the above that is discovered may lead to the removal of both the non-residential person from the event and any other members discovered to be facilitating this action. No refund will be given for ticket or accommodation in these cases, nor any other form of remuneration. At the discretion of committee, such instances may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the club or future events.\n* If you participate in any club auctions and submit a bid for an item on sale, you are entering a contract of commitment to pay the bid amount on completion of the auction in the event that you are the winning bidder.\n* Any care delivered by our first-aid team is given on a “best efforts” basis.
